# Stock_market_DSA
Developed a comprehensive stock management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The system simulates real-world stock trading operations including account management, portfolio tracking, and buy/sell transactions, while employing Data Structures and Algorithms for optimized performance.
Key Features:

    Account Management: Managed user accounts, including deposit, withdrawal, and balance tracking.
    Portfolio Management: Implemented a dynamic portfolio using a map to store and update stock holdings.
    Stock Transactions: Designed buy/sell functionality with validation for available balance and real-time portfolio updates.
    Data Structures: Used efficient data structures like vectors for stock lists, maps for portfolios, and queues for transaction logs.
    Algorithm Optimization: Ensured transaction processing and portfolio updates operate in logarithmic or linear time, enhancing system performance.

Technologies: C++, OOP, STL (Standard Template Library), Maps, Vectors, Queues, Algorithms
